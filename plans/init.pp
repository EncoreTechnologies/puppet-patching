# @summary Our generic and semi-opinionated workflow.
#
# It serves as a showcase of how all of the building blocks in this module
# can be tied together to create a full blown patching workflow.
# This is a great initial workflow to patch servers.
# We fully expect others to take this workflow as a build-block and customize
# it to meet their needs.
#
# @param [TargetSpec] targets
#   Set of targets to run against.
#
# @param [Boolean] filter_offline_targets
#   Flag to determine if offline targets should be filtered out of the list of targets
#   returned by this plan. If true, when running the <code>puppet_agent::version</code>
#   check, any targets that return an error will be filtered out and ignored.
#   Those targets will not be returned in any of the data structures in the result of
#   this plan. If false, then any targets that are offline will cause this plan to error
#   immediately when performing the online check. This will result in a halt of the
#   patching process.
#
# @param [Optional[Boolean]] monitoring_enabled
#   Flag to enable/disable the execute of the monitoring_plan.
#   This is useful if you don't want to call out to a monitoring system during provisioning.
#   To configure this globally, use the `patching_monitoring_enabled` var.
#
# @param [Optional[String]] monitoring_plan
#   Name of the plan to use for disabling/enabling monitoring steps of the workflow.
#   To configure this globally, use the `patching_monitoring_plan` var.
#
# @param [Optional[String]] update_provider
#   What update provider to use. For Linux (RHEL, Debian, SUSE, etc.) this parameter
#   is not used. For Windows the available values are: 'windows', 'chocolatey', 'all'
#   (both 'windows' and 'chocolatey'). The default value for Windows is 'all'. If 'all'
#   is passed and Chocolatey isn't installed then Chocolatey will simply be skipped.
#   If 'chocolatey' is passed and Chocolatey isn't installed, then this will error.
#
# @param [Optional[String]] pre_update_plan
#   Name of the plan to use for executing the pre-update step of the workflow.
#
# @param [Optional[String]] post_update_plan
#   Name of the plan to use for executing the post-update step of the workflow.
#
# @param [Optional[String]] reboot_message
#   Message displayed to the user prior to the system rebooting
#
# @param [Optional[Enum['only_required', 'never', 'always']]] reboot_strategy
#   Determines the reboot strategy for the run.
#
#    - 'only_required' only reboots hosts that require it based on info reported from the OS
#    - 'never' never reboots the hosts
#    - 'always' will reboot the host no matter what
#
# @param [Optional[Integer]] reboot_wait
#   Time in seconds that the plan waits before continuing after a reboot. This is necessary in case one
#   of the groups affects the availability of a previous group.
#   Two use cases here:
#    1. A later group is a hypervisor. In this instance the hypervisor will reboot causing the
#       VMs to go offline and we need to wait for those child VMs to come back up before
#       collecting history metrics.
#    2. A later group is a linux router. In this instance maybe the patching of the linux router
#       affects the reachability of previous hosts.
#
# @param [Integer] disconnect_wait How long (in seconds) to wait before checking whether the server has rebooted. Defaults to 10.
#
# @param [Optional[String]] snapshot_plan
#   Name of the plan to use for executing snaphot creation and deletion steps of the workflow
#   You can also pass `'disabled'` or `undef'` as an easy way to disable both creation and deletion.
#
# @param [Optional[Boolean]] snapshot_create
#   Flag to enable/disable creating snapshots before patching groups.
#   A common usecase to disabling snapshot creation is that, say you run patching
#   with `snapshot_create` enabled and something goes wrong during patching and
#   the run fails. The sanpshot still exists and you want to retry patching
#   but don't want to create ANOTHER snapshot on top of the one we already have.
#   In this case we would pass in `snapshot_create=false` when running the second time.
#
# @param [Optional[Boolean]] snapshot_delete
#   Flag to enable/disable deleting snapshots after patching groups.
#   A common usecase to disable snapshot deletion is that, say you want to patch your
#   hosts and wait a few hours for application teams to test after you're done patching.
#   In this case you can run with `snapshot_delete=false` and then a few hours later
#   you can run the `patching::snapshot_vmware action=delete` sometime in the future.
#
# @param [Optional[Enum['none', 'pretty', 'csv']]] report_format
#   The method of formatting the report data.
#
# @param [Optional[String]] report_file
#   Path of the filename where the report should be written. Default = 'patching_report.csv'.
#   If you would like to disable writing the report file, specify a value of 'disabled'.
#   NOTE: If you're running PE, then you'll need to disable writing reports because it will
#   fail when running from the console.
#
# @param [Boolean] noop
#   Flag to enable noop mode for the underlying plans and tasks.
#
# @example CLI - Basic usage
#   bolt plan run patching --targets linux_patching,windows_patching
#
# @example CLI - Disable snapshot creation, because an old patching run failed and we have an old snapshot to rely on
#   bolt plan run patching --targets linux_patching,windows_patching snapshot_create=false
#
# @example CLI - Disable snapshot deletion, because we want to wait for app teams to test.
#   bolt plan run patching --targets linux_patching,windows_patching snapshot_delete=true
#
#   # sometime in the future, delete the snapshots
#   bolt plan run patching::snapshot_vmare --targets linux_patching,windows_patching action='delete'
#
# @example CLI - Customize the pre/post update plans to use your own module's version
#   bolt plan run patching --targets linux_patching pre_update_plan='mymodule::pre_update' post_update_plan='mymodule::post_update'
#
# @example CLI - Wait 10 minutes for systems to become available as some systems take longer to reboot.
#   bolt plan run patching --targets linux_patching,windows_patching --reboot_wait 600
