# @summary Querys a targets operating system to determine if a reboot is required and then reboots the targets that require rebooting.
#
# Patching in different environments comes with various unique requirements, one of those
# is rebooting hosts. Sometimes hosts need to always be reboot, othertimes never rebooted.
#
# To provide this flexibility we created this function that wraps the `reboot` plan with
# a `strategy` that is controllable as a parameter. This provides flexibilty in
# rebooting specific targets in certain ways (by group). Along with the power to expand
# our strategy offerings in the future.
#
# @param [TargetSpec] targets
#   Set of targets to run against.
# @param [Enum['only_required', 'never', 'always']] strategy
#   Determines the reboot strategy for the run.
#
#    - 'only_required' only reboots hosts that require it based on info reported from the OS
#    - 'never' never reboots the hosts
#    - 'always' will reboot the host no matter what
#
# @param [String] message
#   Message displayed to the user prior to the system rebooting
#
# @param [Integer] wait
#   Time in seconds that the plan waits before continuing after a reboot. This is necessary in case one
#   of the groups affects the availability of a previous group.
#   Two use cases here:
#    1. A later group is a hypervisor. In this instance the hypervisor will reboot causing the
#       VMs to go offline and we need to wait for those child VMs to come back up before
#       collecting history metrics.
#    2. A later group is a linux router. In this instance maybe the patching of the linux router
#       affects the reachability of previous hosts.
#
# @param [Integer] disconnect_wait How long (in seconds) to wait before checking whether the server has rebooted. Defaults to 10.
#
# @param [Boolean] noop
#   Flag to determine if this should be a noop operation or not.
#   If this is a noop, no hosts will ever be rebooted, however the "reboot required" information
#   will still be queried and returned.
#
# @return [Struct[{'required' => Array[TargetSpec], 'not_required' => Array[TargetSpec], 'attempted' => Array[TargetSpec], 'resultset' => ResultSet}]]
#
#    - `required` : array of targets whose host OS reported a reboot is required
#    - `not_required` : array of targets whose host OS did not report a reboot being required
#    - `attempted` : array of targets where a reboot was attempted (potentially empty array)
#    - `resultset` : results from the `reboot` plan for the attempted hosts (potentially an empty `ResultSet`)
